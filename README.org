* Org.jl
[[https://travis-ci.org/non-Jedi/Org.jl][https://travis-ci.org/non-Jedi/Org.jl.svg?branch=master]] [[https://coveralls.io/github/non-Jedi/Org.jl?branch=master][https://coveralls.io/repos/github/non-Jedi/Org.jl/badge.svg?branch=master]]

This is an incomplete experiment in how quickly I can slap together a
parser for org-mode files without bothering to gain any background in
parsing theory. Org-mode documents will be parsed according to my
understanding of org rather than according to the org-mode source code
or any formal grammar.

** Usage

Parse an org string or ~IO~ into an ~Org.Document~ with
~Org.parse_org~. ~Org.Document~ and all its children elements will
have a field containing their children elements called
~contents~. Some types of org constructs may have additional fields
with information.

** TODO Org.jl improvements before it's useful

- [X] Develop architecture that can handle context-sensitivity
- [X] Parse headlines
- [X] Parse paragraphs
- [X] Hook parsers together to parse whole document instead of only elements
- [ ] Integrate with [[https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl][Documenter.jl]]
  - [ ] Export parsed org to whatever format is used by Documenter.jl
  - [ ] [[https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/1074][Integrate with upstream feature branch]]
- [X] Document the package
- [ ] Register in [[https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/][General]]
